# three-body-simulation
This Python script simulates the three-body problem, modeling the chaotic motion of three gravitationally interacting bodies. It calculates their positions and velocities over time using Newton's laws and visualizes the results in a 3D plot featuring trajectories for each body, offering a striking view of their interactions
